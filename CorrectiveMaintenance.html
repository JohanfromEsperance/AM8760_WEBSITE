        <p>Definition: Maintenance activities performed to correct faults and restore assets to their optimal operating condition.</p>
        <p>Expanded Description: Corrective Maintenance (CM) involves performing maintenance tasks after a fault or failure has been detected. The goal is to restore the asset to its optimal operating condition as quickly and efficiently as possible. CM can include repairs, replacements, or adjustments needed to fix the identified issue. This approach is reactive and focuses on addressing immediate problems to minimize downtime and maintain operational continuity.</p>
