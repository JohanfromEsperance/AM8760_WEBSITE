        <h2>Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM)</h2>
        <p>Definition: A maintenance strategy focused on ensuring that assets continue to perform their required functions within their current operating context.</p>
        <p>Expanded Description: Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a systematic approach to maintenance that focuses on maintaining the functions of assets, rather than just their physical condition. It involves identifying critical functions, assessing failure modes and their effects, and prioritizing maintenance tasks based on their impact on overall system reliability. RCM aims to optimize maintenance efforts by focusing on activities that enhance the reliability and performance of assets.</p>
