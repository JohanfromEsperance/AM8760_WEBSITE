        <h2>Risk-Based Inspections</h2>
        <p>Definition: An inspection strategy that prioritizes inspections based on the risk associated with asset failure.</p>
        <p>Expanded Description: Risk-Based Inspections (RBI) focus on prioritizing inspection efforts on assets that pose the highest risk to operations if they fail. This approach uses risk assessment tools to evaluate the likelihood and consequences of asset failures, allowing maintenance teams to allocate resources more effectively. RBI helps in optimizing inspection schedules, improving safety, and reducing the likelihood of unexpected failures.</p>
