        <h2>FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis)</h2>
        <p>Definition: A systematic approach to identifying and evaluating potential failure modes and their impacts on asset performance.</p>
        <p>Expanded Description: Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a proactive risk management tool used to identify potential failure modes of an asset and evaluate their effects on performance and reliability. FMEA helps in prioritizing maintenance activities by focusing on the most critical failure modes. This systematic approach involves assessing the likelihood, severity, and detectability of failures, and developing mitigation strategies to minimize their impact.</p>
